# Destiny2AutoHookFish

1.  This script is used to automatically hook fish in Destiny2.

    After download the .py file, you should install python3 from network, and also install pip.

    By using pip, you should run: 
      pip install keyboard, pyautogui, PIL, easyocr

    If success, please press 'j' to start hooking, and press 'p' to pause. If you press 'k', this script will be terminated.


2.  I also successfully package this script as .exe in https://drive.google.com/file/d/10FJUns_j096-d5zujGk3wSXY2VkyB26-/view?usp=sharing 
    You can download and use it immediately, but its version is different from main.py in Github.
